						<i>From 1984 to 2003, psychiatrist Isaac Galatzer-Levy of the New York University School of Medicine carried out a study on 774 Germans who had lost their jobs. Published in the Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology and Economics, the research reached a comforting conclusion: the negative psychological effects of losing one's job are short-term and tend to run their course within a year, while the long-term psychological effects are limited: resilience, then, is stronger than the loss of a job. In the study they compare the reaction to losing a job to other highly traumatic events, like the death of a partner, a terrorist attack, a near-death incident: the pattern of reactions found was similar and shows an elevated capacity of people to deal with and overcome these traumas.</i>

						<i>Across the globe, the economic crisis has led to soaring youth unemployment&#151;above 50 percent in Spain, nearly that high in Greece and above 30 percent in many other countries. The crisis also has exacerbated already-high levels of youth unemployment in the Middle East and North Africa, where frustrated, unemployed college graduates were at the forefront of last year's Arab Spring revolutions. Angry, jobless youths have taken to the streets in other countries, as well, including the UK. Countries are grappling with the problem, but solutions remain elusive. Youth unemployment is seen both as a matter of demographics&#151;disproportionately higher numbers of young people in many countries&#151;and structural problems in labour markets, such as laws protexting older workers' jobs. Many observers believe if the issue isn't addressed, further upheavals will occur, while others worry that the world could be facing a "lost generation" of discouraged workers whose earnings will be diminished for decades.</i>

						<i>Last summer </i>New York<i> magazine published a cover story explaining why having a kid more or less ruins your life. It featured beautifully forlorn photographs of a couple with twins and mostly dismal conclusions from psychologists and sociologists about the effect of offspring on parental happiness. ... But before you abandon junior at the mall, consider a new study that argues that reproducing probably won't make you any less happy in the long run. There's a chance it might. But there's also a chance children might add significantly to your bliss.</i>

						<i>Most people would assume that losing your job would have grave psychological effects, such as depression, worry, feelings of helplessness, doubts about the future, and a general attitude of frustration and unhappiness about one's condition. But a new study reported in Science Daily ... claims most people bounce back and end up just as satisfied with their lives as they were before they lost their jobs.</i>

						<i>As millions of workers have discovered in recent years, losing a job is upsetting and unsettling and can reduce even the most stoic to tears. But buck up. About a year later, the majority of people have shaken off the unemployment blues and have returned to their previous levels of happiness, a new study reveals.</i>
