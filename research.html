					<p class="research-head">Purpose and Goals</p>
					<p class="research-text">The <b>purpose</b> of this study is to identify factors that influence peoples' feelings of long-term distress following a physical assault. While some people recover quickly from a stressful event, others are distressed by the event for longer periods of time.</p>
					<p class="research-text">The <b>goal</b> of this study is to find ways to predict who will be distressed by a stressful event for a long period of time, and who will recover within a shorter period of time. This is a necessary step towards finding the most effective ways to <b>help</b> people who are at risk for being distressed or depressed for long periods following a stressful life event.</p>
					<p class="research-text">By gathering a variety of information about your initial response to your event that brought you to Bellevue Hospital, we can use this information to <b>understand</b> why some people will be distressed for a long period following the event, while other people will recover quickly.</p>

					<p class="research-head">About the Study</p>
					<p class="research-text"><b>Visit 1: Emergency Department (20 minutes)</b> The first visit is brief and it would take place today, in the Emergency Department. We would ask you some standard questions about your immediate response to your injury or accident.</p>
					<p class="research-text"><b>Visit 2: Phone Screen Interview (30 minutes)</b> The phone interview will take place within approximately 7 days of your visit to the Bellevue Emergency Department. <i>This can be done at home</i> or in the hospital if you have not yet been discharged. During the phone interview, we will ask you questions about how you have been feeling and thinking since the time of the event that brough you to Bellevue. Your responses to these questions will determine if you meet <i>the final requirements to take part in the study</i>.</p>
					<p class="research-text"><b>Visit 3: One Month after ED Visit (4 hours)</b> This visit will take place within appropriately 30 days of your visit to the Bellevue Emergency Department. There are several different components to the one month visit and the visit will take place in a private room at One Park Avenue. Components include: two online assessments, an interview, Affective Regulation, and some <i>non-invasive</i> physiological tests.</p>
					<p class="research-text"><b>Visit 4: Three Months after ED Visit (1 hour)</b> This visit will take place 3 months after your visit to Bellevue Hospital. This visit includes an online assessment and <i>can be done at home</i>.</p>
					<p class="research-text"><b>Visit 5: Six Months after ED Visit (1 hour)</b> This visit will take place 6 months after your visit to Bellevue Hospital. This visit includes an online assessment and <i>can be done at home</i>.</p>
					<p class="research-text"><b>Visit 6: Twelve Months after ED Visit (1 hour)</b> This visit will take place 12 months after your visit to Bellevue Hospital. This visit includes an online assessment and <i>can be done at home</i>.</p><br>

					<p class="research-text">Federal law required us to protext the privacy of any health information that identified you. This law is called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We must keep all of your personal health information private unless you give us permission to share some of it. We will protect your confidentiality by storing any information from your medical chart in a file that does not include identifying information.
