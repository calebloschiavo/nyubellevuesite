					<h3>What is the purpose of this study?</h3>
					<p>The purpose of this study is to identify personal, social, cognitive and physical factors that influence peoplesâ€™ feelings of long-term distress or long-term depression following a physical injury, accident or physical assault. While some people recover quickly from a stressful event, others are distressed by the event for longer periods of time. The goal of this study is to find ways to predict who will be distressed by a stressful event for a long period of time, and who will recover within a shorter period of time.</p> <p>This is a necessary step towards finding the most effective ways to help people who are at risk for being distressed or depressed for long periods following a stressful life event. By gathering a variety of information about your initial response to the event that brought you to the Bellevue Hospital Emergency Department, we can use this information to understand why some people will be distressed for a long period following the event, while other people will recover quickly.</p>
